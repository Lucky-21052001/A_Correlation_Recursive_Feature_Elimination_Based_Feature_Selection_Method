This project focuses on classifying Pearson disease using a dataset with 756 features. The aim is to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models both before and after applying a hybrid feature selection method. The project involves the application of correlation feature selection followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) to enhance model performance and interpretability.
